Welcome to our new blog! Here you will find techy news mostly about compute clouds such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Softlayer, or OpenStack.

At [Cloud Niners](http://cloud9ers.com) we have a tendency to prefer open-source solutions, so yes lots of those too. Expect lots of Linux and other unices in the news. DevOps and infrastructure automation with a light touch of data analysis and crunching.
